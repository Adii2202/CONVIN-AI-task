# Daily Expenses Sharing Application

This project is a backend service for managing users and expenses for a daily expenses sharing application. It allows users to add expenses and split them based on three different methods: equal amounts, exact amounts, and percentages. We can also create groups here and get groups with the amounts. The application also provides functionality to download a balance sheet that shows who owes whom.
